    <h3>Powers</h3>
    <p>
        In the movies and the earlier comic books, Tony Stark is a human. Outside the suit, he does not have any
        superpowers, however he is very intelligent. He made the suit himself. Iron Man can fly and shoot beams from his
        hands using special technology called "repulsors" in his boots and gloves. He is not hurt by most weapons like
        guns and cannons because of his armor. There are many versions of the Iron Man suit, because Stark keeps making
        improvements.
    </p>

    <h3>Origin story</h3>
    <p>
        Stark inherited a large American company called "Stark Industries" when his father died. He was badly injured by
        a bomb in an attack planned by people who did not like him running his company. Shrapnel from the explosion was
        moving towards his heart. This would have killed him, but a scientist called Yinsen who was with him made a
        magnet for his chest which would keep the shrapnel away. In the movies, he makes an "arc reactor" which is put
        into his chest to stop the shrapnel.
    </p>
    <h2>Personality</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Tony Stark is charismatic and eccentric, he is also very proud, but also very      altruist and heroic. He did not
        have a good childhood, and this affects how he acts.
        Stark is very smart, and a very talented inventor. His technology is always very advanced, and Iron Man is his
        greatest piece of work. In both the comics and the movies, he uses the arc reactor (or "repulsor technology") as
        a form of sustainable energy to help the world.
