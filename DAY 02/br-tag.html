    <h1>Write twinkle twinkle little star poem</h1>
    <p>
        Twinkle, twinkle, little star,<br>How I wonder what you are!<br>Up above the world so high,<br>Like a diamond in
        the sky.<br>
        When the blazing sun is gone,<br>When he nothing shines upon,<br>Then you show your little light,<br>Twinkle,
        twinkle, all the night.<br>Then the traveler in the dark<br>Thanks you for your tiny spark,<br>How could he see
        where to go,<br>If you did not twinkle so?<br>In the dark blue sky you keep,<br>Often through my curtains
        peep<br>For you never shut your eye,<br>Till the sun is in the sky.<br>As your bright and tiny spark<br>Lights
        the traveler in the dark,<br>Though I know not what you are,<br>Twinkle, twinkle, little star.
    </p>
